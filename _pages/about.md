# Welcome to the DigiCube Project  

The rapid growth of the space sector is driven by advancements in satellite miniaturisation, particularly with CubeSats—nanosatellites defined by standardised 10 cm cubic "units." CubeSats have gained popularity due to their cost-efficiency and versatility, with applications ranging from academic research to planetary defense missions like the European Space Agency's Hera project, which uses CubeSats for multi-point asteroid analysis.  

While CubeSat standardisation simplifies some aspects of development, mission success still relies heavily on efficient monitoring and optimisation during construction and operation. Currently, limited real-time insights and design optimisation tools increase the risk of mission failure due to unforeseen subsystem interactions or malfunctions.  

## About the Project  

The **DigiCube Project** addresses this challenge by developing a fully modular, generic digital twin for CubeSats using a **Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)** approach in MATLAB Simulink.  

A digital twin acts as a virtual replica of a physical CubeSat, mirroring real-time data to monitor, predict, and optimise its performance. This innovation promises to improve CubeSat mission reliability by offering a comprehensive platform for:  
- **Design Analysis and Optimisation**  
- **System Integration and Testing**  
- **Post-Launch Monitoring and Fault Detection**  

## Project Approach  

Subsystems within the digital twin are developed concurrently and integrated seamlessly, following a robust high-level system plan. This modular design ensures adaptability, supporting mission teams across every phase of a CubeSat project—from initial design to in-orbit operations.
