In today's world, the rapid expansion of the space sector is heavily supported by the miniaturisation of satellites and their components. CubeSats are a class of nano satellites that have become increasingly popular due to their standardisation practices which define each satellite in terms of 10cm cubic ‘units’- currently being used within the European Space Agency's Hera planetary defence mission to conduct a multi-point analysis of an asteroid. Although standardisation simplifies some aspects of CubeSat projects, these missions still require efficient monitoring and optimisation during both construction and operation. Currently, real-time insights into CubeSat performance and design optimisation methods are limited, increasing the risk of mission failure due to unanticipated subsystem interactions or malfunctions. Digital twins, as virtual replicas of physical systems, offer a promising solution by mirroring real-time data to monitor, predict, and optimise performance, enhancing CubeSat mission reliability. 

The DigiCube project aims to design and model a fully modular, generic digital twin of a CubeSat within MATLAB Simulink by way of a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach. The digital twin should support mission teams throughout the design, optimisation and post-launch operation phases of a mission – providing a comprehensive platform for system analysis, testing and fault detection. Each subsystem will be designed and created concurrently, in line with a high-level system plan, to ensure seamless subsystem integration and adaptability.
